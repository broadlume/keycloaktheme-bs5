# a Bootstrap v5 Keycloak Theme (WIP)

A simple Bootstrap v5 based Keycloak Theme.

I didn't have much luck finding something like this that was open source, so I wanted to make one and make it available for all to use.

This is still a work-in-progress as I am trying to replicate all the various pages. Feedback and suggestions welcome. :)

## Usage

Download the repo, place it in the `themes` directory in your Keycloak instance.

The theme pulls the app name from the name of the realm automatically.

The theme also allows you to use a custom logo, so upload your logo with the name of `Logo.png` under `resources/img/`.

Thanks! :)
